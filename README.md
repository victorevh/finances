# React financial control app

to start the app you can use **yarn start**

The react project was developed in **TypeScript**. I'm using **styled components** and the **polished** library to style the components. I also use **React modal** to display app modals and use **Mirage JS** to build a fake API and simulate page routes in a future backend integration.
